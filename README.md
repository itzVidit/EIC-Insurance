1.🚗 EIC Insurance Collapse Analysis Dashboard
An interactive Power BI dashboard designed to investigate the financial downfall of EIC, a fictional motor insurance company, by analyzing underwriting performance, premium-to-claim dynamics, and customer behavior—enabling strategic insight into risk concentration and operational inefficiencies.

2.🔍 Project Purpose:
This dashboard equips business, finance, and underwriting teams with a comprehensive view of EIC's key performance indicators (KPIs) including Premium Earned, Claims Paid, Underwriting Losses, and the Premium-to-Claims (P/C) Ratio. Through dynamic visuals, it reveals high-risk vehicle categories, claim behavior patterns, and the underlying causes of financial unsustainability that led to EIC’s closure.

3.🛠 Tech Stack:
Built using the following tools and technologies:

📊 Power BI Desktop – Core tool for data visualization, interactive reporting, and dashboard deployment
📂 Power Query – Used for data transformation, filtering by policy type and time period
🧠 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Developed custom measures like Cumulative Loss, P/C Ratio, Average Premium, and dynamic tooltips
🧮 Data Modeling – Established relationships among policy data, claim records, and a calendar table to ensure accurate time-series aggregation
📁 File Format – .pbix used for development and .png exports for dashboard previews

4.📊 Data Source:
Synthetic insurance dataset simulating operations of a mid-sized motor insurer. The data includes:

Premiums and claims at policy level

Time-stamped financial activity from 2014–2018

Customer segmentation by gender, region, usage type, and vehicle type

Quarter and year breakdowns through a custom calendar table

5.🎯 Goal of the Dashboard:
To build a clean, interactive Power BI report that illustrates the complete financial trajectory of EIC—from initial growth to collapse—by tracking loss-making trends, segment-specific performance, and quarterly deterioration of key insurance metrics. The dashboard is structured to enable drill-down analysis by category and support investigative business storytelling.

6.💡 Features & Highlights:
🔹 Key Visuals & Interactions:

a. Executive KPI Cards: Display overall Premium Collected, Claims Paid, Underwriting Loss, and P/C Ratio, enabling quick assessment of EIC’s operating condition.

b. Quarterly P/C Ratio Column Chart: Visualizes underwriting efficiency over time, showing only one quarter with favorable ratios—Q2 2018.

c. Cumulative Underwriting Loss Area Chart: Highlights the accelerating financial loss trend leading to company failure.

d. Premium vs Claim Scatter Plot: Identifies segments with negative margins, exposing risk-heavy categories.

e. Vehicle Type Breakdown (Bar Chart): Shows claim-prone vs. profit-generating vehicle types across the portfolio.

f. Claims by Gender & Usage Type (Donut + Stacked Area): Provides demographic and usage-level segmentation of claims to uncover bias or behavioral trends.

g. Page Navigation Button: “Explore the story 👉” button links users to a deeper analytical page, creating a narrative-driven flow.

7.💼 Business Impact & Outcomes:
The dashboard replicates how a real-world insurer could uncover underwriting failures early by tracking segment-wise losses and inefficiencies. It demonstrates how BI tools can support actuarial teams, pricing analysts, and risk officers in:

Isolating loss-making categories

Evaluating demographic claim trends

Responding with targeted pricing or withdrawal strategies
